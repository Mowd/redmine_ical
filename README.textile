h1. Redmine Ical

ICalendar (ICS) view of issue and version due dates.

h2. Requirements

* icalendar >= 1.1.5 (http://icalendar.rubyforge.org/).

h2. Installation

Generic Redmine plugin installation instructions can be found in the "Redmine wiki":http://www.redmine.org/wiki/redmine/Plugins#Installing-a-plugin.

Note that this plugin doesn't require a database migration but 2 patches included in the @extra@ folder. The gist of it is: go to your redmine directory, run the following commands and restart redmine:

<pre>git clone https://git.fachschaften.org/redmine_ical
patch -p 1 < vendor/plugins/redmine_ical/extra/ics_format_accepts_key_auth.patch
patch -p 1 < vendor/plugins/redmine_ical/extra/view_calendars_show_bottom_hook.patch</pre>

h2. Features

Issue and version due dates are exported as calendar events.

The plugin is "custom query"-aware, thus you can add @&query_id=1@ to the link generated by redmine to see only issues as per the custom query with ID 1. Sadly the Redmine User Interface is lacking in that regard and I haven't found a nice way to auto-generate those URLs.

You can also navigate to a global calendar to view all your issues and versions accross the whole redmine by going to http://your.redmine/issues/calendar, the link to the ical view is available there too.
